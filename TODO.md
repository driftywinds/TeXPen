Priority
- [ ] Gray out quantized selections for now (bad performance)
- [ ] Unload model on page refresh, ensure never double loaded/memory leak etc.
- [ ] if the user draws new input or switches model, queue the inference, allow up to 3 seconds for previous one to finish, else skip to new

Bugs
- [ ] fix light mode
